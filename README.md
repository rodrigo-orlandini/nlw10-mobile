# NLW Cup (Mobile) âš½ðŸ“±

This application was created during the Rocketseat's Next Level Week 10 event.<br>
The objective of this project is to provide an easy way to manage sports bets between friends, family, etc.

My participation in this project aimed to practice and improvement about new concepts related to **React Native**.

### Technologies: 
* **_React Native_**
* **_Typescript_**

In addition to these technologies mentioned above, some other important libraries and tricks were used, such as **_Axios_** to HTTP requests and **_OAuth_** for third-party authentication.

Check out the [project's official repository](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-copa-ignite) on Rocketseat's Github for more information.
